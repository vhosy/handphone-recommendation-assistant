## Demo Flows

### Demo flow #1

1. **Start with inputting a valid Customer ID (Valid Customer IDs take values 1 to 10):**
   - Customer: "10"
   - The Agent uses get_cust_tool to extract customer's information, addresses customer by name and ask if they want to upgrade to latest model of the same brand customer is using
   - Agent: "Hi Joshua, I see that you're currently using a Samsung Galaxy S23. Are you interested in upgrading to the latest Samsung model?"

2. **Handphone recommendation:**
   - The Agent will use the recommendation_tool to extract the latest handphones that are in the handphone database of Telco shop.
   - Customer can choose to accept the recommendation or ask for other specifications like colour or price for agent to retrieve.
   - Customer: "Do the S25+ come in other colours?"
   - Agent: "Yes, besides Icyblue and Blueblack (Online Exclusive), the Samsung Galaxy S25+ is also available in Coralred (Online Exclusive) and Mint."

It's a great way to keep your phone charged on the go, especially with all the amazing features of the S25+. Would you like to add it to your order?"
